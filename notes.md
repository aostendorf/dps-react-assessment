Friday Night Notes:
Started out ok. Got the .env file + git.ignore & .env example. I wanted to try straight React for this assignment. Started out following the notes and setting up can't seem to get my Axios call to return GET data.

Saturday Notes:
I am struggling to get any beers to show up on a page. I keep hitting an error Unhandled Rejection (TypeError): Cannot read property 'map' of undefined. I am searching but not finding an answer to help. My thinking was that I an trying to map an object maybe instead of an array but I am also not even returning data from the call. Trying to look up info for axios calls. 

Sunday Notes:
Still stuck. From the terminal it appears like I am making axios calls but I am not getting anything back. Going to refactor at least beers to redux in the morning.

Monday Notes:
Ok refactored beers for redux and can see the 50 beers when I look deep into props but can't get them to page. I am not sure what I am doing wrong. Not seeing errors just a couple warnings. Not feeling good about this. I am going to try to work out fitting in more practice time. It has been super hard with my toddler.
